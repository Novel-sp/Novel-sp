# Novel Species Identification

This novel species identification pipeline is designed to automate the discovery of new microbial species using genome-resolved metagenomics. Built on the Snakemake framework, it integrates multiple bioinformatics tools into a unified, reproducible workflow. The pipeline streamlines quality assessment, taxonomic classification, and functional analysis of metagenomic assemblies, ensuring consistency, scalability, and accuracy across large-scale microbial studies.
